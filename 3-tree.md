# Tree

**Introduction**
A tree is a very useful data structure. Similar to a linked list, a tree is populated with nodes and each node contains pointers to elements to its left and right. Trees make searches extremely efficient when properly organized. 


**Example**

```python

# Example of a node
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self,left = left
        self.right = right
```
