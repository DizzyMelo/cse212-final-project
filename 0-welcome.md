# Data Structures Final Project

Welcome to the Data Structures Final Project. 

* [Stack](1-stack.md)
* [Linked List](2-linked_list.md)
* [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples for the Data Structure selected. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
